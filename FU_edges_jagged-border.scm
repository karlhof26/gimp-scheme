; Original information 
;
; Jagged Border, V1.1
;
; AUTHOR: theilr (http://flickr.com/photos/theilr), (c) 2009
;
; This script was tested with GIMP 2.6.7
; DESCRIPTION: Creates a white (or black) border around an image that
; merges in with the image so that on a larger white (or black)
; background, the image appears to have a ragged border.  This is
; similar to the Gimp's Fuzzy Border, but it adapts its jaggedness to
; the image. (Also unlike Fuzzy Border, it is deterministic, it does
; not depend on random number seeds.)
;
; The script is located in menu "<Image> / Filters / theilr"
; But it probably belongs in "<Image> / Filters / Decor"
;
; USAGE NOTES: Since this non-destructively produces a border as a
; separate layer, you can tweak the border; eg smooth it (yuck, then
; it's not very jagged anymore!), change its color, use it to build
; some fancy drop-shadow, etc.  A number of effects can be obtained by
; using the white/black border layer and/or its inverse as a layer
; mask.
;
; You can apply the border to other images.  For instance, you can
; make a high (or low) contrast version of your image for the purpose
; of making the border, but once you have the border, you can apply it
; to your original image.
;
; If you don't like the rounded corners in the Rectangular mode, you
; can run Horizontal and Vertical separately and then just merge them
;
; If you check "Enforce one-pixel border" than your border will be at least
; one pixel wide around the whole image. Usually you won't need this, but
; if you have very dark things at the border of the image, they might get
; in the way of the fuzzy select.
;
; BUGS:
; Smooth amount is assumed to be double the border size; this is ad hoc
; Ideally, the border would adjust itself to be as narrow as possible at
;   its thinnest point.  No point wasting good pixels!
; Currently, the border is "seeded" from UL and LR corners, can forsee 
;   situations when this would be inadequate; eg, very dark component 
;   running through the border.  I'm implemented workaround that basically
;   adds a one-pixel border around the whole image.
; Threshold is a parameter, but in practice I always use 1, maybe should
;   just remove it as a parameter.
; I really don't like the rounded corners that Rectangular mode gives; the
;   default should be what you get when you make horizontal and vertical
;   borders separately and then combine them -- currently, you have to do
;   that manually.
; I don't know what this will do if layer and canvas are different sizes;
; I can imagine neat effects where you might want to specify (eg, with a
;   selection) a border that only surrounds part of your image.
; No way to interactively change a lot of these parameters; you just
;    have to try different values and see what you get
; Need a better name for this script (ragged border? adaptively ragged?)
; Q: does it make sense to have borders any color other than black or white?
;
; SCRIPT SUMMARY:
; Make new layer which is black with a white border, blur the border,
; add the new layer to a copy of the image of interest, select the 
; white area, and throw away that temporary layer.  Make a new layer, 
; which is white over the selection (which is the border area), 
; and black in the interior.  This layer is in ADDITION-MODE, and so
; the black interior is effectively transparent.
;
; To make black borders, the strategy is essentially the same, except
; that the original image is inverted before being added to the blurred
; white frame.  After the new border layer is generated, it is inverted,
; and changed from ADDITION-MODE to MULTIPLY-MODE.
;
; Version 1.0 (Oct 2009) -- 
; Version 1.1 (Nov 2009) -- added option for black borders
; Version 1.2 (May 2020) -- Revised to work with Gimp 2.10.18
